This is a mobile platformer game developed in Android Studio using Kotlin. The player controls a character in a vibrant 2D environment by tilting the phone to move left or right and tapping the screen to jump. The game features a variety of obstacles, each with its own unique collision behavior that affects the player differently, creating a dynamic and engaging gameplay experience.

In addition to the core mechanics, the main menu screen includes a visually appealing background animation with softly floating colored bubbles that add a playful and polished touch to the interface. The project demonstrates motion-based controls, responsive touch interaction, collision handling and animated visual elements designed specifically for Android devices.
