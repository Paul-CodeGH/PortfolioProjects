**<h2>Features</h2>**

The software is connected to a SQLite3 database to ensure that all the Todos, including the completed ones remain saved until deleted manually by the user.

The user has the option to create a new ToDo by filling out the Title and the Description. 

Each ToDo can be placed anywhere within the container simply by drag and drop. When trying to place a ToDo outside the screen, the container will scale, giving the user more space to place multiple ToDos at once. 

Once a ToDo is completed, you can Delete it or Finish it by clicking on one of the buttons. Finishing a ToDo will place it within The History to Do Tab and remains there until deleted manually.
