This was my Final Client Side Coding Project for my University FH St. Poelten, Austria.

It is a 2D Browser Platformer, where you control a character by jumping and moving left and right. The main goal is to finish the level by following InGame Instructions. The game contains a checkpoint system, which can take you back to your last saved location, in case you fall.
